# 3D-Reconstruction
This repository contains various methods/algorithms that I tried to implement 3d-reconstruction using single 2d images. <br>
 <br>
 
 The different algorithms implemented were: <br>
 1. [NeRF](https://github.com/chakshu-dhannawat/3D-Reconstruction/blob/main/Tiny_Nerf.ipynb) <br>
 2. [PIFuHD] (https://github.com/chakshu-dhannawat/3D-Reconstruction/blob/main/PIFuHD_v1_Demo_try.ipynb) from facebook. Used to create 3d models from single human images.<br>
 3.
